# ⚙️ Widget MCP

Add simple widgets to you LLM chat for common situations like timers, conversions and more.

## Motivation

MCP-UI opens the door to [breaking the text wall](https://shopify.engineering/mcp-ui-breaking-the-text-wall) from chat UIs we've been using the last few years. The full extent of what's possible is 

This project shows the floor of what's possible by providing a few simple widgets for common situations.

If you've ever google "convert X to Y" or "2 minute timer" and see the custom UI results, this should feel very familiar.

## Current widgets

- `Timer` - Editable timer with a chime. 
- `Stopwatch` - Timer that just counts up.
- `Conversion` - Convert between set of units for which the LLM can write a formula. 
- `Display Fact` - When the answer is simple, just show it in an easy to read card.

## Supported MCP Clients

MCP-UI is new and as of August 2025 is only supported by a few clients. 

### Smithery

Try widget-mcp in the Smithery playground. (TODO: pending Smithery deploy)

### Goose

1. [Install Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/quickstart)
2. Click `Extensions` and `Add custom extension`
3. Fill in name as `Widgets` and command `npx widget-mcp`
4. Verify it's working by clicking `Chat` and prompting `2 minute timer`

## Requests for widgets

Here's a few examples of widgets that could be fun to add.

- **Color Picker** - Interactive color selection and palette tools. Could be parameterized to allow the LLM to suggest a color and let the user tweak and explore.
- **Calculator** - Basic and scientific calculator functionality. Initial function seeded by LLM.
- **Dice Roller** - Custom set of dice based on what you ask the agent for.

I'm sure you have some cool ideas!

## Development

Adding new widgets should be very easy! All these widgets are HTML pages that can have variables injected (eg. values provided by the LLM). To add new widgets, add an template file to the `html` directory and a new tool to `index.ts`. 

You can probably just prompt "Add a widget html and tool to do <somethingawesome>. Look at index.ts and timer.html for examples of how". 

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Iterate on the html with hot-reloads
npm run dev:html

# Launch the MCP server with Smithery's web inspector
npm run dev:mcp
```
